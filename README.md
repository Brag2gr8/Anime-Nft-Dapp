# Anime-Nft-Dapp

This Project is a dapp that allows anyone connected on Polygon main network to mint an NFT from an NFT collection of Solidity generated images. It assigns random anime name to the msg.sender (e.g YOU ARE ...) and random image background colour to the image


This project was built with help from [Buildspace](buildspace.so)
